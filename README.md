# AI Time Checker

You ever think ChatGPT has no idea what it's talking about?

This repository contains a collection of templates that allow you to compare the execution speed of two functions: a user-defined function and an AI-generated function. The templates are provided in different programming languages and can be used to measure and compare the performance of the functions.

Some care has been taken to keep these templates as simple as possible and to only utilize standard libraries.

## Templates

Currently, there are templates for these languages:

- Python (2 and 3)
- C#
- JavaScript
- Java
- Lua
- C++ (Version 11 and later)
- C
- Rust
- Ruby
- Go
- TypeScript
- GDScript

Each template includes the to measure the execution time of two separate functions. The template will also print out individual and average execution times for each function.

## Usage

1. Choose your language and copy the code within.
2. Locate the `my_function` and `ai_function` sections in the code.
3. Replace the placeholder code with your own implementation for each function.
4. Set how many times you want to run the test using the `num_runs` variable. (Default is 3).
5. Save and run your code.
6. Analyze the results to compare the performance of the two functions.
7. Tell the robit to suck it!

Feel free to use this against two versions of your own code. AI doesn't need to be involved if you don't wanna.

## Contributing
